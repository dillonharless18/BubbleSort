"""
Read in a file (called "numbers.txt") of integers.  There will be one integer per line.
Your program should:
1) read the file and keep all the values in a list of integers
2) implement a bubble sort algorithm in a function called bubble_sort(),
      use the pseudocode is provided in the textbook, in question 2-2.
3) use the bubble_sort() function to sort the values in the list
4) write the sorted list into an output file called out.txt

"""

def bubble_sort(A):
# implement your bubble sort here




# open the input file
input_numbers = open("numbers.txt", "r")

# create an empty list
nums = []
# read in the lines from the input file, and add the values to the list
for line in input_numbers:




# bubble sort



# write the sorted values into the output file, one value each line.
